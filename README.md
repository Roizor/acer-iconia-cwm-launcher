This is an essentially ancient piece of shellscript software that I've decided to keep here.  

## How To Use
I have made this script insanely easy to use.  
First, run `./launcher (Trigger no.)` and that is it.

## ./launcher didn't work!
If you're already in fastboot, move ahead to just using `./trigger (Trigger no.)`.  
However, you may need to run the launcher to download the Google `platform-tools`.
